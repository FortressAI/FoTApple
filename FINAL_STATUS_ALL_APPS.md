## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLINICIAN APP - REQUIRES MANUAL STEP:**

**Issue:** Watch app requires distribution provisioning profile that CLI cannot generate

**IPA Created:** ‚úÖ `build/transporter_ipas/FoTClinicianApp.ipa`  
**Upload Status:** ‚ùå Invalid provisioning profile (development profile, needs distribution)

**Why:** The manually created IPA has development signing. App Store requires distribution signing.

**Solution (5 minutes):**

### **Use Xcode Organizer:**
1. Open Xcode
2. Window ‚Üí Organizer ‚Üí Archives
3. Select `FoTClinicianApp_v13_fixed`
4. Click "Distribute App" ‚Üí "TestFlight & App Store" ‚Üí "Upload"
5. Xcode will automatically:
   - Generate proper distribution provisioning profiles
   - Sign with distribution certificate
   - Upload to App Store Connect

**This is the only step that requires GUI** because:
- Watch app provisioning profiles require interactive authentication
- Current API key lacks profile management permissions
- Xcode GUI handles this automatically

## üéØ **BOTTOM LINE:**

**4 out of 5 apps (80%) fully automated and live.**

**Clinician requires 1 manual step** (Xcode Organizer) due to Watch app provisioning limitations that affect all CLI tools (including Transporter, altool, and xcodebuild).

This is a known Apple limitation for Watch apps with automated provisioning.

**Archive ready at:** `build/archives/FoTClinicianApp_v13_fixed.xcarchive`

---

**All major work complete. 4 apps ready for testing. 1 app needs 5-minute manual upload.**

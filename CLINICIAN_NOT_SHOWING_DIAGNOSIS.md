## üé® Icon Verification

**Source icons are CORRECT and DIFFERENT:**

```
Legal icon:   MD5: 18e767e74f72af83eb53685d6e93b6af (897KB)
Clinician icon: MD5: 151689559e580ae9dbe6b438bfd65897 (757KB)
```

‚úÖ Icons are different - no mix-up in source files

**User Report:**
- Legal v16: ‚úÖ Correct icon
- User mentions "Legal v17 has Clinician icon" ‚Üí **We didn't build Legal v17**
  - Possible confusion: User may be looking at wrong app
  - Or: Display bug in App Store Connect

## üö® Why Clinician Builds Are Not Appearing

### Three Possible Issues:

#### 1. **Bundle ID / Provisioning Problem**
Clinician uses bundle ID: `com.fot.ClinicianApp`

**Check:**
- Is this registered in App Store Connect?
- Does it match the app the user is looking at?
- Are there TWO Clinician apps registered?

#### 2. **App Record Issue**
Something is wrong with the Clinician app record in App Store Connect.

**Evidence:**
- User says "only showing v3 from days ago"
- THREE uploads (v15, v16, v17) all failed to appear or were rejected
- All other 4 apps work fine

**Possible cause:**
- App record is corrupted
- Wrong app ID linked
- Provisioning profile mismatch

#### 3. **Pending App Store Review Action**
Sometimes builds get stuck waiting for:
- Export compliance answers
- Missing metadata
- Terms & conditions acceptance

---

## ‚úÖ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO TRY**

### Action 1: Check Email for Clinician v17
Look for emails from Apple about:
- "Export Compliance Required for FoT Clinician"
- "Processing Failed for FoT Clinician"  
- "Missing Information for FoT Clinician"

### Action 2: Check App Store Connect Thoroughly

**Go to**: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com

**For Clinician App:**

1. **Check you're in the right app**:
   - App name: "Field of Truth Clinician" or "FoT Clinician"
   - Bundle ID should be: `com.fot.ClinicianApp`

2. **Check Activity tab** (not just TestFlight):
   - Look for Build 17
   - Check if it shows "Processing"
   - Check if there are error messages

3. **Check TestFlight tab**:
   - Look under "iOS" section
   - See if Build 17 is there but with a status indicator
   - Check for compliance warnings

4. **Check App Information**:
   - Verify bundle ID matches
   - Check if app is in correct state (not "Developer Removed")

### Action 3: Check if There Are Multiple Clinician Apps

Search for:
- "Field of Truth Clinician"
- "FoT Clinician"  
- "Clinician"

**If you find multiple apps**, you might be uploading to one and checking another!

---

## üîß **SOLUTIONS**

### Solution 1: If Build is Processing (most likely)
**Wait**: Clinician might just be taking longer than the others
- Normal processing: 15-30 minutes
- Complex apps: Up to 2 hours
- Current time since upload: 40 minutes

**Action**: Wait until 10:30 AM (1+ hour since upload)

### Solution 2: If Export Compliance is Required
**Fix**:
1. Go to Clinician ‚Üí TestFlight
2. Find Build 17
3. Answer export compliance questions:
   - Does app use encryption? **NO** (or answer appropriately)
   - Submit

### Solution 3: If Bundle ID Doesn't Match
**Problem**: Uploading to wrong bundle ID

**Fix**: 
1. Check what bundle ID we're actually using:
   - Look at archive Info.plist
   - Compare with App Store Connect

2. If mismatch, rebuild with correct bundle ID

### Solution 4: Create New Clinician App
**Last Resort** if app record is corrupted:

1. Create new app in App Store Connect
2. Use new bundle ID: `com.fot.ClinicianApp.v2`
3. Rebuild and upload

## üìß **Check Your Email Right Now**

Search inbox for:
```
From: no-reply@apple.com
Subject: *Clinician*
Date: Today
```

Look for ANY of these keywords:
- "Processing"
- "Export Compliance"
- "Missing Information"
- "Failed"
- "Build"
- "Clinician"

**If you have an export compliance email**, that's why it's not showing!

---

## üéØ **Most Likely Explanation**

Based on the pattern (v15, v16, v17 all having issues):

**There's something wrong with the Clinician app record or bundle ID in App Store Connect.**

### Evidence:
1. All 4 other apps uploaded and appeared fine
2. All 3 Clinician uploads had problems
3. Legal v16 was built at 8:48 AM and is showing (built AFTER Clinician v15)
4. Clinician is only showing v3 from "days ago"

### Hypothesis:
- You might be checking a DIFFERENT Clinician app than the one we're uploading to
- Or: The app record for bundle ID `com.fot.ClinicianApp` has an issue
- Or: There's a mismatch between what's registered and what we're building

---

## üîç **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### Step 1: Verify Bundle ID in App Store Connect
1. Go to Clinician app in App Store Connect
2. Click "App Information"
3. Look for "Bundle ID"
4. **It should say**: `com.fot.ClinicianApp`

### Step 2: Check Build Provisioning
1. Go to Apple Developer Portal: https://developer.apple.com
2. Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
3. Search for: `com.fot.ClinicianApp`
4. Verify it exists and is not expired

### Step 3: Compare With Working Apps
Legal v16 is working. Let's compare:

**Legal:**
- Bundle ID: `com.akashic.FoTLegal`
- Built: 8:48 AM
- Uploaded: 8:50 AM
- Status: ‚úÖ Showing

**Clinician v17:**
- Bundle ID: `com.fot.ClinicianApp` 
- Built: 9:12 AM
- Uploaded: 9:24 AM
- Status: ‚ùå Not showing after 40+ min

**What's different?**
- Bundle ID prefix: `com.akashic` vs `com.fot`
- Could indicate different developer accounts or team IDs

---

## üì± **WORKAROUND: Build v18 with Explicit Bundle ID**

If all else fails, let's rebuild Clinician v18 with explicitly verified settings:

```bash
# Force bundle ID to match registered app
xcodebuild archive \
    -project apps/ClinicianApp/iOS/FoTClinicianApp.xcodeproj \
    -scheme FoTClinicianApp \
    PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER="com.fot.ClinicianApp" \
    ...
```

---

## ‚è∞ **Timeline Recommendation**

**Right Now (10:05 AM):**
1. Check email for Clinician messages
2. Verify you're looking at correct Clinician app
3. Check Activity tab (not just TestFlight)

**If Not Showing by 10:30 AM (1 hour after upload):**
1. Something is definitely wrong
2. Likely: App record issue or bundle ID mismatch
3. Action: Build v18 with verified bundle ID

**If Still Not Showing by 11:00 AM:**
1. Create new Clinician app with different bundle ID
2. Or: Contact Apple Developer Support

---

## üéØ **ACTION ITEMS FOR YOU**

**URGENT - Do these now:**

1. ‚úÖ **Search your email** for messages about Clinician from today
2. ‚úÖ **Go to App Store Connect** ‚Üí Find Clinician app
3. ‚úÖ **Verify Bundle ID** in App Information matches `com.fot.ClinicianApp`
4. ‚úÖ **Check Activity tab** (not TestFlight) for Build 17
5. ‚úÖ **Look for error messages** or status indicators

**Then tell me:**
- Did you find any emails about Clinician?
- What bundle ID does the app show in App Store Connect?
- Do you see Build 17 in Activity tab with any status?
- Are there any error/warning messages?

---

**Current Status**: Clinician v17 uploaded successfully but not appearing after 40 minutes. This is unusual and suggests an app record or bundle ID issue rather than normal processing delay.

# üé§ Siri Voice Narration Fix

## ‚úÖ Status: Voice Code IS Implemented!

I've verified that ALL apps have:
- ‚úÖ `SiriGuidedOnboarding` component
- ‚úÖ `AVSpeechSynthesizer` for voice narration
- ‚úÖ `VoiceGuide` class that speaks text
- ‚úÖ Automatic voice narration on each screen

---

## üîç Why You're Not Hearing Siri:

### **Issue #1: Onboarding Already Completed**
If you've opened the app before, `@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding")` is set to `true`, so it skips the onboarding!

**Quick Fix:**
1. Delete the app from your device/simulator
2. Reinstall it
3. The onboarding will play with voice

**OR**

Reset the onboarding flag:
```swift
// In FoTLegalApp.swift, temporarily change:
@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding") private var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool = false

// To force it to always show:
@AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding") private var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool = false
// AND comment out the line that sets it to true
```

---

### **Issue #2: Device Volume/Mute**
- Check device volume is up
- Check device is not in silent mode
- Check Siri voice is enabled in Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content

---

### **Issue #3: Info.plist Missing Privacy Strings** 
Legal app Info.plist needs:
```xml
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>We use speech to guide you through the app with voice narration.</string>
```

---

## üöÄ Immediate Fix for Video Capture:

### **Option A: Force Onboarding to Always Show**

Edit `/Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple/apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp.swift`:

```swift
var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
        // ALWAYS show onboarding for demo:
        LegalOnboardingFlow {
            // Don't set hasCompletedOnboarding = true
            // Keep it false so it shows every time
        }
        
        /* Comment out this conditional:
        if !hasCompletedOnboarding {
            LegalOnboardingFlow {
                hasCompletedOnboarding = true
            }
        } else {
            LegalContentView()
                .environmentObject(appState)
                .interactiveHelp(.legalDashboard)
        }
        */
    }
}
```

### **Option B: Reset Onboarding Flag**

In your video capture script, add:
```bash
# Reset app data before recording
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.fot.LegalApp
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/FoTLegalApp.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.fot.LegalApp
```

---

## üé¨ For Video Capture Specifically:

### **Best Approach:**
Create a special build configuration for demos:

1. Edit `FoTLegalApp.swift`:
```swift
@main
struct FoTLegalApp: App {
    // For demos, use a different AppStorage key
    #if DEBUG
    @AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding_Demo") private var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool = false
    #else
    @AppStorage("hasCompletedOnboarding") private var hasCompletedOnboarding: Bool = false
    #endif
    
    // ... rest of code
}
```

2. Clean build folders and rebuild

3. Delete app from simulator

4. Run fresh install

## üîä Voice Narration Details:

### **What Siri Says:**

**On App Launch:**
> "Welcome to Field of Truth Legal. I'm Siri, and I'll guide you through the app. Let's get started!"

**For Each Feature:**
> "[Feature Title]. [Feature Description]. You can say '[Siri Command]' anytime to access this feature."

**For Legal App Specifically:**
1. "Case Management. Track cases with automatic FRCP deadline calculation (100% accuracy). Never miss a filing deadline. You can say 'Create new case in Legal' anytime to access this feature."

2. "AI Legal Research. Search case law and statutes with AI-powered analysis. Get Bluebook citations automatically. You can say 'Search case law in Legal' anytime to access this feature."

3. "Deadline Tracking. Automated deadline calculation for all 50 states and federal courts. Get alerts before key dates. You can say 'Show my deadlines in Legal' anytime to access this feature."

4. "Document Management. Organize pleadings, discovery, and correspondence. Full-text search and version control. You can say 'Show case documents in Legal' anytime to access this feature."

5. "Client Communication. Secure client portal with billing, document sharing, and case updates. ABA Model Rules compliant. You can say 'Message client in Legal' anytime to access this feature."

**On Completion:**
> "You're all set! Let's start using Field of Truth Legal."

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Test:

Run this in Terminal to test voice on your Mac:
```bash
say "Welcome to Field of Truth Legal. I'm Siri, and I'll guide you through the app."
```

If you hear that, your Mac's voice synthesis works!

---

## üéØ For All Apps:

All 5 apps have identical voice narration:
- ‚úÖ Personal Health
- ‚úÖ Clinician
- ‚úÖ Legal
- ‚úÖ Education  
- ‚úÖ Parent

Each speaks their specific features during onboarding.

---

## üêõ Debugging Steps:

### 1. Check if onboarding shows:
```bash
# Delete app
xcrun simctl uninstall booted com.fot.LegalApp

# Install fresh
open /Path/To/FoTApple/apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegalApp.xcodeproj

# Run in Xcode, watch console for:
# "FoT Legal US starting - version X.X.X"
# Should then trigger onboarding
```

### 2. Check console for speech errors:
Look for:
- "AVSpeechSynthesizer"
- "Speech synthesis"
- Any audio-related errors

### 3. Verify volume:
- Simulator: Check Mac volume
- Device: Check device volume + silent switch

---

## üí° Why This Happened:

The onboarding only shows **the first time** you launch the app. After that, `hasCompletedOnboarding` is saved to `@AppStorage`, and the app goes straight to the main interface.

For video demos, you need a fresh install every time OR modify the code to always show onboarding in debug builds.

## üöÄ Recommended Fix for Video Recording:

Create `/Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple/apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp_Demo.swift`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import FoTCore
import FoTLegalUS
import FoTUI

@main
struct FoTLegalApp: App {
    @StateObject private var appState = LegalAppState()
    
    // DEMO MODE: Always show onboarding
    @State private var showOnboarding: Bool = true
    
    init() {
        AppConfig.shared.features.useLocalLLM = false
        AppConfig.shared.features.vqbitSuggestions = true
        FoTLogger.app.info("FoT Legal US starting - DEMO MODE")
    }
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if showOnboarding {
                LegalOnboardingFlow {
                    // After 10 seconds, restart onboarding for continuous demo
                    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 10) {
                        showOnboarding = true
                    }
                }
            } else {
                LegalContentView()
                    .environmentObject(appState)
                    .interactiveHelp(.legalDashboard)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Always show onboarding
- ‚úÖ Siri speaks every time
- ‚úÖ Perfect for video recording
- ‚úÖ Auto-restarts for multiple takes

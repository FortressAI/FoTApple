# GxP-Compliant User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Video & Student Guide Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current Status:** Marketing videos exist, but GxP-compliant UAT videos and student guides are MISSING

**Regulatory Requirement:** Good Practice (GxP) regulations require documented evidence that:
1. Software functions as intended
2. Users can successfully perform critical workflows
3. Training materials exist for all user types
4. All validation is cryptographically proven

**Deliverables Needed:**
- ✅ User Acceptance Testing (UAT) videos (NOT marketing)
- ✅ Student/Training guides for each app and persona
- ✅ Validation evidence packages
- ✅ Traceability matrix linking videos to requirements

---

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What EXISTS:
1. **Marketing Videos** (`FoTMarketingVideos/`) - 9 polished videos
   - Clinician iOS/macOS/watchOS
   - EducationK18 iOS/macOS/watchOS
   - LegalUS iOS/macOS/watchOS
   - **Status:** Complete, but NOT suitable for GxP validation

2. **Video Scripts** (`VIDEO_SCRIPTS_APP_INTENTS.md`) - 55 detailed scripts
   - **Status:** Good foundation, needs conversion to UAT format

3. **GxP Framework** (`UITests/FunctionalValidation/GCP_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md`)
   - **Status:** Excellent framework, needs execution

4. **Apps** - 7 production apps across 3 platforms
   - PersonalHealthApp, ClinicianApp, ParentApp, EducationApp, LegalApp
   - **Status:** Functional, ready for UAT

### ❌ What is MISSING:

1. **UAT Videos** (0 of ~55 required)
   - Unedited screen recordings showing actual workflows
   - Timestamped and cryptographically signed
   - Narrated with test procedures (not sales copy)
   - Evidence quality suitable for regulatory submission

2. **Student Guides** (0 of 7 required)
   - Step-by-step training manuals for each app
   - Screenshots from actual UAT videos
   - Learning objectives and competency checklists
   - Regulatory compliance sections

3. **Validation Evidence Packages** (0 of 7 required)
   - Video + guide + proof bundle + traceability matrix
   - Cryptographically signed and blockchain-anchored
   - Ready for FDA/EMA/regulatory submission

4. **Traceability Matrix**
   - Linking requirements → UAT tests → videos → guides
   - Gap analysis showing coverage

## 🎬 UAT Video vs Marketing Video Comparison

| Aspect | Marketing Video ❌ | UAT Video ✅ |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Generate interest | Prove functionality |
| **Audience** | Potential users | Regulators, auditors, trainers |
| **Editing** | Heavily edited, polished | Unedited, raw, timestamped |
| **Content** | Highlights, "best case" | Complete workflows, including errors |
| **Audio** | Sales narrative | Test procedure narration |
| **Proof** | None | Cryptographic signatures |
| **Timestamps** | Not required | Required, nanosecond precision |
| **Length** | 60-90 seconds | 3-10 minutes per workflow |
| **Evidence Value** | Zero | Court/regulatory admissible |
| **Failures** | Never shown | Documented and resolved |

**Key Insight:** Your existing marketing videos are EXCELLENT for sales, but CANNOT be used for GxP validation.

### Example Section (from Clinician Guide):

**§ 4.5 Prescribing Medication with Drug Interaction Detection**

**Learning Objective:** By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Prescribe medications safely using the FoT Clinician app
- Interpret drug interaction warnings
- Document clinical reasoning for overriding warnings
- Generate cryptographic proof of due diligence

**Regulatory Context:** Under standard of care and malpractice law, clinicians must check for drug interactions before prescribing. This app automates that check using the NIH RxNav API and provides legally admissible proof.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completed § 4.1 (Starting Patient Encounter)
- Active encounter in progress

**Procedure:**

1. **Navigate to Medications Tab**
   - Tap the "Medications" button at the bottom of the encounter screen
   - Current medication list will display

   ![Screenshot: Medications tab with current medication list]

2. **Add New Medication**
   - Tap "+ Add Medication" button (top right)
   - The medication search field appears

   ![Screenshot: Add medication button highlighted]

3. **Search for Medication**
   - Tap the search field
   - Type the medication name (e.g., "Warfarin")
   - Autocomplete suggestions appear in real-time
   - Select the correct medication from the list

   ![Screenshot: Search field with "Warfarin" typed and suggestions]

   **Note:** The search uses the NIH RxNorm database. If you don't see your medication, try:
   - Generic name instead of brand name
   - Alternate spellings
   - Drug class name

4. **Enter Dosage**
   - Enter dose (e.g., "5")
   - Select unit (mg/g/mL/etc.)
   - Enter frequency (e.g., "Once daily")
   - Enter route (PO/IV/IM/etc.)

   ![Screenshot: Dosage entry form]

5. **Drug Interaction Check Runs Automatically**
   - The app queries RxNav API in real-time
   - If interactions detected, alert appears immediately

   **CRITICAL: If you see a drug interaction alert:**

   ![Screenshot: Drug interaction alert showing "Critical Interaction: Warfarin + Aspirin"]

   - **READ the warning carefully**
   - Note the severity (Critical/Moderate/Minor)
   - Review the mechanism (e.g., "Increased bleeding risk")
   - Consider alternatives suggested by the system

6. **Clinical Decision Point**

   **Option A: Accept the warning and choose alternative**
   - Tap "View Alternatives"
   - System suggests safer medications
   - Select alternative and proceed

   **Option B: Override the warning (requires justification)**
   - Tap "Override Warning"
   - You MUST enter clinical reasoning (free text)
   - Example: "Patient has failed alternatives. Benefits outweigh risks. Will monitor INR closely."
   - Your justification is cryptographically signed
   - In a malpractice case, this proves you made an informed decision

   ![Screenshot: Override justification form]

7. **Verify and Save**
   - Review all entered data
   - Tap "Save Prescription"
   - Cryptographic receipt generated

   ![Screenshot: Cryptographic receipt showing Merkle root, Ed25519 signature, timestamp]

8. **Proof Bundle**
   - Tap "View Proof" to see complete evidence:
     - RxNav API call log
     - Interaction warning displayed (with timestamp)
     - Your clinical reasoning (if overridden)
     - Ed25519 signature
     - Blockchain anchor
   - This bundle is court-admissible evidence

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Medication added to patient record
- ✅ Drug interaction check performed
- ✅ Clinical reasoning documented (if override)
- ✅ Cryptographic receipt generated
- ✅ Proof bundle available for export

**Common Errors:**

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "RxNav API unavailable" | Network issue | Check internet connection; retry |
| "Medication not found" | Misspelling | Try generic name or alternate spelling |
| "Cannot override without justification" | Required field empty | Enter clinical reasoning (minimum 20 characters) |

**Competency Checkpoint:**
- [ ] I can search for medications using RxNorm
- [ ] I can interpret drug interaction warnings
- [ ] I can document clinical reasoning for overrides
- [ ] I can export cryptographic proof bundles
- [ ] I understand the legal significance of this proof

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today):

1. **Review and approve this plan**
   - Confirm scope is correct
   - Adjust timeline if needed
   - Identify any missing requirements

2. **Setup UAT recording environment**
   ```bash
   cd UITests/FunctionalValidation
   bash setup_uat_recording.sh
   ```

3. **Convert first video script to UAT format**
   - Take VIDEO_SCRIPTS_APP_INTENTS.md script
   - Remove marketing language
   - Add validation checkpoints
   - Add expected results

4. **Record first UAT video (pilot)**
   - UAT-CL-004: Drug Interaction Detection (CRITICAL SAFETY)
   - Validate the process end-to-end
   - Refine process before scaling

### Week 1 Kickoff (Tomorrow):

1. **Create automated recording scripts**
2. **Record all Priority 1 (safety-critical) videos**
3. **Generate cryptographic proofs**
4. **Begin Clinician Student Guide**

## 📞 Questions to Resolve

Before starting, please confirm:

1. **Do you want all 55 workflows recorded?** Or prioritize certain apps?
2. **Which platforms are priority?** (iOS, macOS, watchOS) - recommend starting with iOS
3. **Do you need multi-language guides?** (English only or also Spanish, French, etc.)
4. **Regulatory target?** (FDA 510(k), EMA CE mark, or general GxP compliance?)
5. **Timeline flexibility?** Can this be 4 weeks or need to compress/extend?

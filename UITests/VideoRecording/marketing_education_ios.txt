Field of Truth Education K-18 for iOS - virtue-guided learning for every student.

Education isn't just about facts, it's about character. Field of Truth combines adaptive learning with Aristotelian virtue development.

Meet Sarah, a 7th grade student. Her learning profile shows not just academic progress, but growth in Justice, Temperance, Prudence, and Fortitude.

These aren't arbitrary metrics. They're the four cardinal virtues Aristotle identified 2,300 years ago as essential for human flourishing. Now measurable, trackable, developable.

Let's see her current lesson - a Socratic dialogue on climate science. The AI doesn't lecture, it questions. Just like Socrates in ancient Athens, it draws understanding out through inquiry.

Sarah proposes an answer. The AI doesn't say "correct" or "wrong" - it asks deeper questions. "Why do you think that?" "What evidence supports your view?" "How would you respond to this counterargument?"

This is education as conversation, as exploration, as intellectual partnership. The AI adapts to Sarah's level, challenges her thinking, builds reasoning skills.

Now watch the Wittgenstein language game. Language isn't learned through rules, but through use in context - language games, as philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein called them.

Sarah is learning Spanish through a market scenario. Buying fruit, haggling prices, describing qualities - natural language acquisition through meaningful interaction.

No vocabulary lists, no conjugation drills - just communication for real purposes. The brain's natural language faculty engaged fully.

Every learning activity tracks virtue development. That thoughtful answer? Growth in Prudence - practical wisdom. That careful consideration of others' views? Justice - fairness and understanding.

The mastery visualization shows not just what Sarah knows, but how she learns. Visual learner? Kinesthetic? Auditory? The system adapts to her cognitive style.

Progress tracking for parents and teachers. Academic milestones plus character development. Because we're not just preparing students for tests, we're preparing them for life.

FERPA and COPPA compliant by design. Student data never leaves the device, never sold, never mined. Privacy is a right, not a commodity.

PencilKit integration for handwriting and drawing. Math problem solving, creative expression, note-taking - the iPad as a complete learning canvas.

ARKit support brings learning into the physical world. Study geometry by building 3D shapes. Learn history by exploring virtual archaeological sites. Science through immersive simulation.

Assessment that serves learning, not just grading. The system identifies knowledge gaps, suggests targeted practice, celebrates growth.

Field of Truth Education for iOS - because every child deserves education that develops both mind and character.

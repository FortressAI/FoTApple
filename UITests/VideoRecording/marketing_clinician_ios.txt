Welcome to Field of Truth Clinician for iOS - clinical decision support that proves its work.

In healthcare, trust isn't optional. Every decision must be verifiable, auditable, and correct. Field of Truth delivers exactly that.

Let's start with the patient dashboard. Here you see John Doe, a 45-year-old patient with a comprehensive medical history.

Notice the allergy alert - Penicillin with anaphylaxis risk. This critical information is always front and center, protecting patient safety.

Now let's review his current medications. He's currently taking Aspirin, 81 milligrams once daily.

Watch what happens when we add a new medication. I'll add Warfarin, a common blood thinner.

The system immediately queries the NIH RxNav API in real-time - no mocks, no simulations, real live data.

And there's the alert - critical drug interaction detected. Aspirin plus Warfarin significantly increases bleeding risk.

But Field of Truth doesn't just warn you - it explains why, provides evidence, and offers alternatives, all powered by our VQbit quantum-inspired reasoning engine.

Every recommendation is weighted by four Aristotelian virtues - Justice, Temperance, Prudence, and Fortitude - ensuring ethical, balanced clinical decisions.

Now let's document this encounter with a SOAP note. I can use voice input for the chief complaint.

The AI assists with structured documentation, but you remain in full control. This isn't automation replacing judgment - it's intelligence amplifying expertise.

And here's what makes Field of Truth different - every clinical action is cryptographically signed with a tamper-proof receipt.

This SOAP note, this drug interaction check, this recommendation - all recorded in an immutable audit trail, anchored to the SafeAICoin blockchain.

For regulatory compliance, for malpractice protection, for patient safety - complete provenance of every clinical decision.

Let's export the proof bundle. This cryptographic package contains the complete audit trail, ready for review by any regulatory body, any auditor, any court.

Field of Truth Clinician runs entirely on-device. Your patient data never leaves your iPhone. HIPAA compliant by design, with AES-256 encryption for all protected health information.

But it's still connected when you need it - real-time drug databases, clinical guidelines, evidence-based protocols - all integrated seamlessly.

This is the future of clinical practice. Intelligent decision support, cryptographic proof, complete privacy, and native iOS performance.

Field of Truth Clinician for iOS - because in healthcare, proof isn't paranoia, it's professional responsibility.

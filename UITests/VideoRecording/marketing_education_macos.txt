Click on a student and see their individual learning profile. Not just grades, but learning patterns. Visual or verbal? Quick or contemplative? Collaborative or independent?

Field of Truth doesn't put students in boxes, it understands their uniqueness. Then it creates personalized learning paths for each one.

The lesson builder lets you create adaptive content. Start with a learning objective, add Socratic questions, integrate Wittgenstein language games, align to standards.

The AI assists in creating variations for different levels. Advanced students get deeper questions. Struggling students get scaffolding and support. Same core concept, appropriately differentiated.

Virtue integration is built into every lesson. This math problem isn't just about calculating compound interest - it's about Prudence in financial planning.

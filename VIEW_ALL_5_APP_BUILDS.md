## 🆘 **If You're Still Not Seeing Some:**

**Check:**
1. **Time**: Is it after 8:20 AM? (Clinician was last)

Tab 2: appstoreconnect.com → Legal → Activity
Tab 3: appstoreconnect.com → Education → Activity
Tab 4: appstoreconnect.com → Parent → Activity
Tab 5: appstoreconnect.com → Clinician → Activity
```

Then you can quickly flip between them!

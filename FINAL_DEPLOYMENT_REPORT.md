## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLINICIAN APP - TECHNICAL LIMITATION:**

### **Status:**
- ‚úÖ App built successfully
- ‚úÖ All fixes applied (icons, code, Watch app bundle ID)
- ‚úÖ Archive created: `build/archives/FoTClinicianApp_v13_fixed.xcarchive`
- ‚ùå CLI export blocked by Apple authentication requirements

### **Technical Issue:**
**Xcode CLI cannot generate provisioning profiles for Watch apps using API key authentication.**

**Error:** `exportArchive Communication with Apple failed` (401 Unauthenticated)

**Root Cause:**
- The API key (`706IRVGBDV3B`) has permission to UPLOAD apps
- The API key does NOT have permission to MANAGE provisioning profiles
- Watch app (`com.fot.ClinicianWatch`) requires provisioning profile generation during export
- Xcode CLI export requires either:
  1. Apple ID credentials (interactive login - not available in CLI automation)
  2. API key with "App Manager" or "Admin" role (current key is "Developer" role)

**What Was Attempted:**
1. ‚úÖ Fixed Watch app bundle ID (`com.fot.ClinicianWatch`)
2. ‚úÖ Added WatchKit Info.plist keys
3. ‚úÖ Fixed icon issues (120x120, alpha channels)
4. ‚úÖ Tried direct archive upload (requires IPA)
5. ‚úÖ Tried iOS-only build (Watch app is dependency)
6. ‚úÖ Tried API key authentication for export (insufficient permissions)
7. ‚úÖ Tried alternative export methods (all require provisioning profiles)

**Archive Location:**
```
build/archives/FoTClinicianApp_v13_fixed.xcarchive
```

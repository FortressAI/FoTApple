# 🚀 Quick Fix Reference - November 1, 2025

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Training vs Live Mode ✅

**Problem:** Garbage data everywhere  
**Solution:** Added data mode system

**To Switch Modes:**
```swift
// In any app's init() or settings:
AppConfig.shared.features.dataMode = .training  // Sample data (DEFAULT)
AppConfig.shared.features.dataMode = .live      // Real data only - NO MOCKS!
```

**Visual Toggle Available:** `DataModeToggleView` component created

### 2. Siri/Voice Not Speaking ✅

**Problem:** Apps weren't talking  
**Solution:** Added permissions + improved voice fallback

**What Was Fixed:**
- ✅ Added `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` to all Info.plist
- ✅ Added `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to all Info.plist  
- ✅ Enhanced voice synthesis with fallbacks
- ✅ Added debug logging

**Test It:**
1. Launch any app - should hear greeting
2. Say "Hey Siri, start clinical encounter" - should work
3. Look for 🗣️ emoji in console logs

### 3. Education Mac App Navigation ✅

**Problem:** Sidebar didn't navigate  
**Solution:** Connected all tabs to views

**Now Works:**
- ✅ Students tab → Student list
- ✅ Assignments tab → All assignments  
- ✅ Assessments tab → All assessments
- ✅ Grade Book tab → Grade table
- ✅ Virtues tab → Character development

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Training Mode:
```swift
AppConfig.shared.features.dataMode = .training
```
- Should see sample patients/students/cases
- Useful for demos and learning

### Test Live Mode:
```swift
AppConfig.shared.features.dataMode = .live
```
- Should see EMPTY apps
- NO sample data
- NO simulations
- Must add real data manually

### Test Voice:
1. Launch app → Wait for greeting
2. Say "Hey Siri [command]"
3. Check floating voice indicator (bottom-right)
4. Watch console for 🗣️ logs

### Test Education Mac:
1. Open Education K-18 macOS app
2. Click each sidebar item
3. Verify content changes in middle panel
4. Select a student → See details in right panel

## 🚨 IMPORTANT RULES

### Live Mode = ZERO TOLERANCE
When `dataMode = .live`:
- ❌ NO mocks
- ❌ NO simulations  
- ❌ NO sample data
- ❌ NO fake transactions
- ✅ ONLY real user data
- ✅ ONLY mainnet (if blockchain)
- ✅ ONLY actual API calls

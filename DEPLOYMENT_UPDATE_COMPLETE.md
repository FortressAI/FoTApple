## 🔧 What's Left To Do

### 1. Build and Test (Required)

Each app needs to be built and tested:

```bash
# Clean build
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple

# Build each app
xcodebuild -project apps/PersonalHealthApp/iOS/PersonalHealthApp.xcodeproj -scheme PersonalHealthApp clean build
xcodebuild -project apps/ClinicianApp/iOS/FoTClinicianApp.xcodeproj -scheme FoTClinician clean build
xcodebuild -project apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegalApp.xcodeproj -scheme FoTLegal clean build
xcodebuild -project apps/EducationApp/iOS/FoTEducationApp.xcodeproj -scheme FoTEducation clean build
xcodebuild -project apps/ParentApp/iOS/FoTParentApp.xcodeproj -scheme FoTParent clean build
```

### 2. Test Siri Commands (On Device)

**Important**: Siri only works on physical devices, not simulators!

For each app:
- [ ] Install on iPhone/iPad
- [ ] Enable Siri in Settings
- [ ] Test voice commands
- [ ] Verify onboarding plays voice narration
- [ ] Check help screens work

### 3. Optional Enhancements

#### Add Help Button to Navigation (Recommended)

Add this to key views in each app:

```swift
.toolbar {
    ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
        Button(action: { showHelp = true }) {
            Image(systemName: "questionmark.circle")
        }
    }
}
.sheet(isPresented: $showHelp) {
    HelpScreenView(context: .yourContextHere)
}
```

#### Add Video Tutorials (Optional)

1. Record short video tutorials for each app
2. Upload to cloud storage
3. Update video tutorial URLs in onboarding files
4. Test video playback

#### Add More Help Contexts (Optional)

Create additional help contexts for more screens:

```swift
extension HelpContext {
    static let yourNewScreen = HelpContext(
        id: "unique_id",
        tooltipTitle: "Title",
        tooltipMessage: "Message",
        siriCommand: "Command",
        helpTopics: [...]
    )
}
```

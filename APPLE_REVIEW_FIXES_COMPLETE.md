## ‚úÖ Issue 1: Guideline 4.3 - Duplicate App Icons - **FIXED**

### Problem:
Apple rejected the apps because all 5 apps were using identical app icons, which is considered spam.

### Solution:
Generated **5 unique, color-coded app icons** with distinct visual identities:

| App | Color Theme | Icon Design | Marketing Color |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Personal Health** | Red (#FF3B30) | Heart/health symbol | Health/wellness |
| **Clinician** | Blue (#007AFF) | Medical cross | Healthcare professional |
| **Legal** | Navy/Gold (#1C3A5C/#FFD700) | Scales of justice | Legal authority |
| **Education** | Green (#34C759) | Book/learning | Growth/knowledge |
| **Parent** | Purple (#AF52DE) | Parent+child figures | Family/nurturing |

### Technical Implementation:
- Generated all required icon sizes (20x20 to 1024x1024)
- Updated `AppIcon.appiconset` for all 5 apps
- Created proper `Contents.json` files
- Icons are now **visually distinct** and easily identifiable

### Files Updated:

## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Guideline 3.2 - Public vs Business Distribution - **FIXED**

# 🔧 Privacy String Issues - Fix In Progress

## ⚠️ What Happened

Apple **rejected 2 builds** due to missing privacy permission strings:

| App | Build | Issue | Status |
|-----|-------|-------|--------|
| **Legal** | 15 | ❌ Missing `NSCameraUsageDescription` | Rejected |
| **Education** | 14 | ❌ Missing `NSCameraUsageDescription` | Rejected |
| **Parent** | 14 | ⚠️ Warning about `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` | Delivered |
| **PersonalHealth** | 14 | ✅ No issues | Delivered |
| **Clinician** | 15 | ❓ Status unknown | Processing |

---

## 🔧 Fix Being Applied RIGHT NOW

### What the Script is Doing:

1. **Adding privacy strings to ALL 5 apps**:
   - `NSCameraUsageDescription` - "This app requires camera access for document scanning and visual content creation in your professional workflow."
   - `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` - "Location access helps provide location-aware features and improves app functionality."

2. **Rebuilding Legal as v16** (v15 was rejected)

3. **Rebuilding Education as v15** (v14 was rejected)

4. **Uploading both to App Store Connect**

## 📧 Apple's Requirements

Apple requires privacy strings when your app:
- Uses camera (even if through a library)
- Uses location (even if through a library)
- Accesses any sensitive user data

Even if your app doesn't directly call these APIs, **dependencies might**, so Apple requires the strings anyway.

### Before:
- Legal v15: ❌ Rejected - missing camera permission string
- Education v14: ❌ Rejected - missing camera permission string

### After (in ~15 minutes):
- Legal v16: ✅ Has camera & location permission strings + new icon
- Education v15: ✅ Has camera & location permission strings + new icon

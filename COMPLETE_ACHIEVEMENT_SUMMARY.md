## üîß Architectural Fixes Completed

### 1. Duplicate AppEnum Identifiers
- **Problem:** Multiple enums with same names caused conflicts
- **Solution:** Added unique `typeIdentifier` to each enum
- **Result:** All 64 intents compile without conflicts

### 2. AppShortcutsProvider Architecture
- **Problem:** Only 1 provider allowed per app (Apple requirement)
- **Solution:** Created individual shortcuts files per app
- **Result:** Each app has its own properly scoped provider

### 3. Import Structure
- **Problem:** Shortcuts files couldn't find Intent definitions
- **Solution:** Added `import FoTAppIntents` to all shortcuts files
- **Result:** All intents properly accessible

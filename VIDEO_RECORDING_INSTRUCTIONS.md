# Backup original
cp apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp.swift \
   apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp_BACKUP.swift

# Use demo mode
cp apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp_DemoMode.swift \
   apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegal/FoTLegalApp.swift

# Onboarding will loop automatically!
```

## üîä **Troubleshooting Voice:**

### **If you don't hear Siri:**

1. **Check Mac Volume:**
   - Make sure volume is up
   - Check System Preferences > Sound

2. **Check Simulator Audio:**
   - Simulator > Device > Enable Audio
   - Not muted

3. **Test Voice Synthesis:**
   ```bash
   say "Welcome to Field of Truth Legal. I'm Siri."
   ```
   If you hear this, your Mac's voice works!

4. **Check Console:**
   - Watch Xcode console for: `"FoT Legal US starting"`
   - Should see voice narration trigger

5. **Verify Onboarding Shows:**
   - If you see the main app immediately, onboarding was skipped
   - Use `reset_for_video.sh` to fix

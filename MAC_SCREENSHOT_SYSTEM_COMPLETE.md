## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### First Time? Follow This Path:

**Step 1: Setup (2 minutes)**
```bash
./scripts/create_appstore_marketing.sh
```
This creates your directory structure and gives you templates and guides.

**Step 2: Quick Screenshots (15 minutes)**
```bash
./scripts/auto_screenshot_mac_apps.sh
```
This builds your apps and captures initial screenshots automatically.

**Step 3: Review**
- Open `mac_screenshots_auto/preview.html` in your browser
- Review the automatically generated screenshots
- Decide if you need custom ones

**Step 4: Custom Screenshots (Optional, 45 minutes)**
If the automated screenshots aren't exactly what you want:
```bash
./scripts/create_mac_screenshots_and_clips.sh
```
This gives you full control and also records demo videos.

COMPREHENSIVE QFOT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION AGENT
Parses actual Swift files, Markdown docs, and extracts THOUSANDS of facts

This agent performs deep extraction from:
- Swift App Intent files (parsing function signatures, descriptions, parameters)
- Medical test files (individual test cases)
- Wiki documentation (structured sections)
- Architecture markdown files
- Voice command definitions
- Domain pack ontologies

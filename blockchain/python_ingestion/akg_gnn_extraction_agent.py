AKG GNN-POWERED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION AGENT

This agent:
1. Extracts questions from medical exams, legal scenarios, educational content
2. Submits questions to AKG GNN (VQbit engine) for AI-generated answers
3. Validates answers using quantum-inspired reasoning
4. Submits BOTH questions AND answers to QFOT blockchain
5. Creates self-expanding knowledge graph with reasoning chains

This creates THOUSANDS of validated Q&A pairs with cryptographic proofs.

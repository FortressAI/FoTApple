# 🎉 QFOT KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION AGENTS COMPLETE

## Overview

You now have **3 powerful extraction agents** that use the **AKG GNN (VQbit engine)** to create a **self-expanding knowledge base** of THOUSANDS of facts on the QFOT blockchain!

## ✅ What We've Built

### 1. **Background Knowledge Agent** 
`blockchain/python_ingestion/background_knowledge_agent.py`

- Extracts pre-written expert knowledge
- Medical board exam cases (Cardiology, Pulmonology, Nephrology, etc.)
- App Intent definitions (Health, Clinician, Legal, Education)
- Legal knowledge (Constitutional law, FRCP, Evidence)
- Educational frameworks (Bloom's Taxonomy, IEP, FERPA)
- Technical architecture (Cryptography, HIPAA, VQbit)
- Compliance regulations (Stark Law, Anti-Kickback, COPPA)

**Output:** ~32 high-quality facts per run

### 2. **AKG GNN Q&A Generation Agent** ⭐ NEW!
`blockchain/python_ingestion/akg_gnn_extraction_agent.py`

- **Extracts questions** from medical, legal, and educational domains
- **Queries the AKG GNN** (VQbit engine) to generate AI answers
- Creates **Q&A pairs** with reasoning chains
- Includes **confidence scores** (0.0-1.0)
- Shows **virtue guidance** (Justice, Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude)
- Provides **source citations** and **reasoning paths**

**Key Innovation:** The AI generates its own answers and submits them to the blockchain!

**Example Q&A Pair:**
```
Question: "72-year-old male with sudden right-sided weakness and aphasia 
90 minutes ago. BP 185/95. NIH Stroke Scale 15. CT head negative for hemorrhage. 
What is the urgent management?"

Answer (VQbit 96% confidence): "Acute ischemic stroke requiring IMMEDIATE tPA 
thrombolysis. Patient within 4.5-hour therapeutic window. Management per AHA/ASA 
Stroke Guidelines 2019: (1) IMMEDIATE tPA 0.9mg/kg (10% bolus, 90% over 60 
minutes), (2) BP management: permissive hypertension before tPA, lower to <185/110 
for tPA administration, (3) No anticoagulants/antiplatelets for 24 hours post-tPA..."

Reasoning: Identified acute stroke → Verified tPA window → Checked contraindications 
→ Retrieved AHA/ASA protocols → Generated urgent treatment plan

Virtue Scores: Justice=0.95, Prudence=0.92, Temperance=0.88, Fortitude=0.85
```

**Output:** ~40 facts per run (20 questions + 20 AI-generated answers)

### 3. **Comprehensive Extraction Agent**
`blockchain/python_ingestion/comprehensive_extraction_agent.py`

- **Parses Swift files** - extracts App Intent signatures, descriptions, parameters
- **Parses Markdown docs** - Wiki pages, documentation, statistics
- **Generates voice command facts** - All 64+ Siri commands
- **Platform feature facts** - Architecture, accessibility, security

**Output:** 50-100+ facts per run (depends on repo size)

## 📊 Current Status

**Total Facts Submitted:** ~170+ facts  
**Breakdown:**
- Batch 1-5: 60 facts (medical, health, legal, education intents)
- Batch 6-9: 38 facts (more intents, virtues, medical cases)
- Background Agent: 32 facts
- AKG GNN Agent: 40 facts (20 Q&A pairs)

**Target:** 1,000-10,000 facts (ongoing)

## 🚀 How to Run Continuous Extraction

### Option 1: Run All Agents Once
```bash
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple/blockchain/python_ingestion
chmod +x run_continuous_extraction.sh
./run_continuous_extraction.sh
```

### Option 2: Run Continuously Until Target
```bash
# Run until 1000 facts
./run_continuous_extraction.sh --max-facts 1000

# Run until 10,000 facts
./run_continuous_extraction.sh --max-facts 10000
```

### Option 3: Run Forever (Background)
```bash
# Run indefinitely
./run_continuous_extraction.sh --continuous

# Or run in background
nohup ./run_continuous_extraction.sh --continuous > extraction.log 2>&1 &

# Check progress
tail -f extraction.log

# Stop when ready
pkill -f run_continuous_extraction
```

### Option 4: Run Individual Agents

**Background Knowledge Agent:**
```bash
cd blockchain/python_ingestion
python3 background_knowledge_agent.py
```

**AKG GNN Q&A Agent (uses AI to generate answers):**
```bash
python3 akg_gnn_extraction_agent.py
```

**Comprehensive Parser:**
```bash
python3 comprehensive_extraction_agent.py
```

## 🧠 How AKG GNN Answer Generation Works

The AKG GNN agent implements the VQbit reasoning process:

1. **Question Extraction** - Parses medical cases, legal scenarios, educational questions
2. **Semantic Embedding** - Converts question to 8096-dimensional vector
3. **Knowledge Graph Search** - Finds relevant facts/rules/inferences
4. **Graph Neural Network** - Aggregates information from connected nodes
5. **VQbit Collapse** - Quantum-inspired optimization selects best answer
6. **Virtue Guidance** - Filters through Aristotelian virtues
7. **Confidence Scoring** - Calculates certainty (0.0-1.0)
8. **Reasoning Chain** - Traces logic path
9. **Source Attribution** - Cites guidelines, research, case law
10. **Blockchain Submission** - Both Q&A submitted with cryptographic proof

**8096-Dimensional VQbit State Space:**
```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ αᵢ|basis_i⟩  where i ∈ {1..8096}

Superposition: Multiple potential answers exist simultaneously
Entanglement: Related knowledge domains correlate
Measurement: Collapse to classical answer
Virtue Bias: H' = H + λ(H_Justice + H_Prudence + H_Temperance + H_Fortitude)
```

## 💰 Earnings Potential

## 🔧 Customization

### Add More Medical Questions

Edit `akg_gnn_extraction_agent.py`:
```python
medical_scenarios = [
    {
        "question": "Your new medical scenario here",
        "domain": "medical",
        "specialty": "Your Specialty",
        "context": {"key": "value"}
    },
    # Add hundreds more...
]
```

### Add More Domains

Create new extraction functions:
```python
def extract_research_papers() -> List[Dict]:
    """Extract questions from research papers"""
    questions = [
        {
            "question": "What is the mechanism of action for...",
            "domain": "research",
            "specialty": "Pharmacology"
        }
    ]
    return questions
```

### Tune VQbit Answer Generation

Modify `generate_vqbit_answer()` function:
```python
# Adjust confidence thresholds
if confidence > 0.95:
    stake = 50.0  # High-confidence facts worth more
elif confidence > 0.85:
    stake = 40.0
else:
    stake = 30.0
```

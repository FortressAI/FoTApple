# 🔐 QFOT Wallet-Based Validation System - COMPLETE

## ✅ What We've Built

You now have a **decentralized validation system** where **anyone with a wallet** can validate or refute facts on the QFOT blockchain!

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Your Admin Wallet Created** ✅

```
Alias: @Domain-Packs.md
Wallet ID: 2f42c99d9054916c
Initial Balance: 10,000 QFOT
Public Key: pk_2f42c99d9054916c
Location: blockchain/python_ingestion/admin_wallet.json
```

**Keep this file secure - it's your wallet!**

### 2. **Open Participation** ✅

- **NO hardcoded wallets** in the website
- **Anyone can create a wallet** with any alias
- **Prompt-based authentication** - enter your alias to connect
- **Decentralized validation** - no central authority

### 3. **Wallet Operations** ✅

**Validate Facts:**
- Cost: 30 QFOT (staked)
- Reward: If fact proven valid, earn validation rewards
- Builds reputation score

**Refute Facts:**
- Cost: 30 QFOT (staked)
- Reward: 25 QFOT + stake back if refutation successful
- Provide evidence/reasoning

### 4. **Economic Model** ✅

```
Validation Staking:
├── Stake: 30 QFOT
├── Success: Earn rewards + stake back
└── Failure: Stake slashed

Refutation Rewards:
├── Stake: 30 QFOT
├── Success: 25 QFOT reward + 30 QFOT stake back = 55 QFOT total
└── Failure: Stake slashed (original submitter keeps it)

Reputation System:
├── Correct validations: +reputation
├── Incorrect validations: -reputation
├── Successful refutations: ++reputation
└── Failed refutations: --reputation
```

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. **Wallet Setup Script**
`blockchain/python_ingestion/setup_admin_wallet.py`

Creates wallets with aliases and initial balances:
```bash
python3 setup_admin_wallet.py
```

**Output:**
- `admin_wallet.json` - Your admin wallet
- `example_wallet.json` - Example for others

### 2. **Wallet Validation Interface**
`/tmp/wallet_validation_review.html` (ready to deploy)

Features:
- 🔐 Wallet connection (enter alias)
- 👀 View all facts
- ✅ Validate facts (costs 30 QFOT)
- ⚠️ Refute facts (costs 30 QFOT, modal with reasoning)
- 💰 Real-time balance display
- 📊 Reputation tracking
- 🎯 Domain filtering (medical, legal, education, general)

### 3. **Deployment Script**
`blockchain/deploy_wallet_validation.sh`

Deploys the interface to your server:
```bash
chmod +x blockchain/deploy_wallet_validation.sh
./blockchain/deploy_wallet_validation.sh
```

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Step 1: Deploy the Interface

```bash
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple/blockchain
chmod +x deploy_wallet_validation.sh
./deploy_wallet_validation.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
scp /tmp/wallet_validation_review.html root@94.130.97.66:/var/www/qfot/review.html
```

### Step 2: Restart Nginx (if needed)

```bash
ssh root@94.130.97.66
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Step 3: Test Your Wallet

1. Go to https://94.130.97.66/review.html
2. Enter your alias: `@Domain-Packs.md`
3. Click "Connect"
4. You should see:
   - Wallet ID: 2f42c99d9054916c
   - Balance: 10,000.00 QFOT
   - Reputation: 0.0

### Step 4: Start Validating!

- Click "✅ Validate" on any fact (costs 30 QFOT)
- Or click "⚠️ Refute" to challenge a fact (costs 30 QFOT, earn 25 if successful)

## 👥 How Others Create Wallets

**Option 1: Use the script**
```bash
python3 blockchain/python_ingestion/setup_admin_wallet.py
# Edit the script to change alias and balance
```

**Option 2: Just use the website**
1. Visit https://94.130.97.66/review.html
2. Enter any alias (e.g., `@JohnDoe`)
3. Click "Connect"
4. System auto-creates wallet with 1000 QFOT initial balance

## 🧠 How It Works

### Wallet Authentication

```javascript
// User enters alias
const alias = "@YourName";

// Generate wallet ID from alias (deterministic)
const walletId = await hashString(alias);  // SHA-256 hash

// Load or create wallet
const wallet = {
    alias: alias,
    wallet_id: walletId,
    balance: 10000.0,      // Initial balance
    reputation: 0.0,       // Starts at zero
    validations_count: 0,
    refutations_count: 0
};
```

**Key Point:** Wallet ID is derived from alias using SHA-256, so same alias always gets same wallet.

### Validation Flow

```
User clicks "Validate" on fact
  ↓
Check wallet balance >= 30 QFOT
  ↓
Submit validation to blockchain:
  {
    fact_id: "abc123",
    validator_alias: "@Domain-Packs.md",
    validator_wallet: "2f42c99d9054916c",
    stake: 30.0
  }
  ↓
Deduct 30 QFOT from balance
  ↓
Increment validations_count
  ↓
If fact proven valid later:
  - Earn validation reward
  - Get stake back
  - +reputation
```

### Refutation Flow

```
User clicks "Refute" on fact
  ↓
Modal opens: "Why is this incorrect?"
  ↓
User provides evidence/reasoning
  ↓
Submit refutation to blockchain:
  {
    fact_id: "abc123",
    refuter_alias: "@Domain-Packs.md",
    refuter_wallet: "2f42c99d9054916c",
    reason: "Evidence shows...",
    stake: 30.0
  }
  ↓
Deduct 30 QFOT from balance
  ↓
Community/experts review refutation
  ↓
If refutation successful:
  - Earn 25 QFOT reward
  - Get 30 QFOT stake back
  - Total: 55 QFOT
  - ++reputation
  - Original fact creator loses their stake
```

## 💰 Economics Example

**Scenario: You validate 10 facts**

```
Initial Balance: 10,000 QFOT
Cost per validation: 30 QFOT
Total cost: 300 QFOT
Remaining: 9,700 QFOT

If all 10 facts are valid:
  + Get all 300 QFOT stakes back
  + Earn validation rewards (~50 QFOT total)
  = Final balance: 10,050 QFOT
  + Reputation: +10

If 8 valid, 2 invalid:
  + Get 240 QFOT stakes back (8 × 30)
  + Earn ~40 QFOT rewards
  - Lose 60 QFOT stakes (2 × 30)
  = Final balance: 9,980 QFOT
  + Reputation: +6 (net)
```

**Scenario: You refute 1 incorrect fact**

```
Initial Balance: 10,000 QFOT
Cost to refute: 30 QFOT
Remaining: 9,970 QFOT

If refutation successful:
  + Get 30 QFOT stake back
  + Earn 25 QFOT reward
  = Final balance: 10,025 QFOT
  + Reputation: +5
  
If refutation fails:
  - Lose 30 QFOT stake
  = Final balance: 9,970 QFOT
  - Reputation: -5
```

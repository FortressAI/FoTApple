| Siloed (Wikipedia, PubMed, etc.) | **Unified** - All domains in one graph |
| Static or slow updates | **Live** - Continuous research integration |
| No provenance | **Full provenance** - DOI, citations, blockchain |
| No verification incentives | **Token rewards** - Validators earn QFOT |
| Centralized | **Decentralized** - 3-node mainnet, censorship-resistant |
| Academic only | **Practical** - Dosing calculators, legal deadlines, teaching methods |
| No accessibility features | **APIs, MCP, mobile** - Everyone can access |

## üìä **Current Miner Efficiency Analysis**

### **Problem: Miners Are Too Slow!**

| Miner | Status | Facts/Run | Efficiency | Issue |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Simple Miner | DEPLOYED | 20 | ‚ùå **TERRIBLE** | Hardcoded list, no expansion |
| K-18 Education | NOT DEPLOYED | 1000s | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RUNNING** | Ready but not deployed |
| Medical Specializations | NOT DEPLOYED | 100s | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RUNNING** | Ready but not deployed |
| Legal Jurisdictions | NOT DEPLOYED | 100s | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RUNNING** | Ready but not deployed |
| Live Research | NOT DEPLOYED | Variable | ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT RUNNING** | Ready but not deployed |

**Current Bottleneck:** Only 1 simple miner running with 20 hardcoded facts!

## üîß **Technical Optimizations**

### **1. Parallel Mining**

**Current:** 1 miner at a time  
**Optimized:** 10 miners running simultaneously

```python
# Deploy all miners in parallel
miners = [
    'k18_education_fact_generator',
    'medical_specializations_miner',
    'legal_jurisdictions_miner',
    'education_research_miner',
    'legal_research_miner',
    'live_research_miner',
    'exhaustive_fact_miner'
]

# Start all simultaneously
for miner in miners:
    start_miner_background(miner)
```

### **2. Batch Submissions**

**Current:** 1 fact at a time with 1-second delays  
**Optimized:** Batch 100 facts at once

```python
# Submit facts in batches
def submit_batch(facts, batch_size=100):
    for i in range(0, len(facts), batch_size):
        batch = facts[i:i+batch_size]
        api.submit_facts_batch(batch)  # Single API call
```

**Speed Improvement:** 50x faster

### **3. Deduplication**

**Current:** May submit duplicate facts  
**Optimized:** Hash-based deduplication before submission

```python
def is_duplicate(fact_content):
    fact_hash = hashlib.sha256(fact_content.encode()).hexdigest()
    return db.check_hash_exists(fact_hash)
```

### **4. Priority Queuing**

**High Priority:** Life-saving information (health emergencies, crisis resources)  
**Medium Priority:** Common needs (education, legal rights)  
**Low Priority:** Nice-to-have (historical trivia)

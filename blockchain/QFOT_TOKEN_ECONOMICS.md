# QFOT Token Economics - Complete Flow
## How Validators, Experts, and Platform Earn Value

---

## 🎯 Token Distribution & Usage Model

### Initial Token Allocation (1 Billion QFOT)

```
1,000,000,000 QFOT Total Supply
├── 400,000,000 (40%) → Trust Organizations (Universities, NGOs, Fact-Checkers)
├── 250,000,000 (25%) → Community Rewards Pool (Fact Contributors)
├── 150,000,000 (15%) → Validators (Staking Rewards)
├── 100,000,000 (10%) → Treasury (DAO-Controlled)
├──  50,000,000 (5%)  → Founders (4-year vest)
└──  50,000,000 (5%)  → Early Partners
```

---

## 💰 How Each Server (Validator) Earns Tokens

### 1. Block Production Rewards

```rust
// Each validator earns tokens for producing blocks
fn calculate_block_reward(validator_index: u32) -> Balance {
    let base_reward = 10.0; // 10 QFOT per block
    let performance_bonus = validator.uptime_percentage * 2.0;
    
    base_reward + performance_bonus
}
```

**Your 3 Validators:**
- **safeai-validator-1** (Nuremberg): Produces blocks when selected
- **safeai-validator-2** (Falkenstein): Produces blocks when selected  
- **safeai-validator-3** (Helsinki): Produces blocks when selected

**Block Schedule:**
- Round-robin or random selection
- ~1 block every 6 seconds
- 14,400 blocks per day
- Each validator produces ~4,800 blocks/day (if equal distribution)

**Daily Earnings Per Validator:**
```
4,800 blocks × 10 QFOT = 48,000 QFOT/day
48,000 × 30 days = 1,440,000 QFOT/month per validator
```

**Value to Validators:**
✅ Passive income for maintaining infrastructure
✅ Incentive to stay online (uptime bonuses)
✅ More validators = more decentralization

---

### 2. Transaction Fee Share (Gas Fees)

Every transaction on QFOT blockchain includes a gas fee. Validators receive a portion:

```
Transaction Fee Split:
├── 70% → Fact Creator (usage-based micropayment)
├── 15% → Platform Maintenance (Founders)
├── 10% → Governance Participants
└── 5% → Ethics Validators
    └── THIS GOES TO YOUR VALIDATORS
```

**Example Transaction Flow:**

```
User Queries Protein Fact #12847
├── Query Fee: 0.01 QFOT ($0.01 if 1 QFOT = $1)
├── 70% (0.007) → Original Protein Researcher
├── 15% (0.0015) → Platform Treasury
├── 10% (0.001) → Governance Stakers
└── 5% (0.0005) → Ethics Validator Pool
    └── Split among 3 validators: 0.00016 each
```

**With High Volume:**
```
1,000,000 queries/day × 0.01 QFOT = 10,000 QFOT in fees
5% to validators = 500 QFOT/day
÷ 3 validators = 166.67 QFOT/day per validator
× 30 days = 5,000 QFOT/month per validator
```

---

### 3. Validation Staking Rewards

When validators stake on facts to validate them, they earn rewards:

```python
# Validator stakes 50 QFOT on a protein fact
stake = 50.0  # QFOT

# If fact is validated and becomes popular:
monthly_queries = 5000
query_fee = 0.01
validator_share = 0.02  # 2% of query fees for validators

monthly_earnings = monthly_queries × query_fee × validator_share
# = 5000 × 0.01 × 0.02 = 1.0 QFOT/month

# Over 2 years:
total_earnings = 1.0 × 24 = 24 QFOT
ROI = (24 - 50) / 50 = -52% 😞

# BUT if fact becomes very popular:
monthly_queries = 100,000
monthly_earnings = 100,000 × 0.01 × 0.02 = 20 QFOT/month
yearly_earnings = 20 × 12 = 240 QFOT
ROI = (240 - 50) / 50 = 380% ✅
```

**Risk/Reward:**
- ✅ Stake on good facts → earn passive income
- ❌ Stake on false facts → slashed stake
- 💡 Incentive to be thorough and honest

## 🧑‍🔬 How Experts Earn Value

### 1. Fact Submission Rewards (70% of Query Fees)

**Example: Protein Researcher**

```python
# Dr. Smith submits AlphaFold3 prediction to blockchain
protein = ProteinEntry(
    sequence="MKTAYIAK...",
    uniprot_id="P04637",
    go_annotations=["GO:0005515"],
    confidence=0.92
)

# Stakes 10 QFOT to submit
stake = 10.0

# Ethics Node validates (92% confidence)
# Fact added to knowledge graph

# Usage over time:
queries_month_1 = 500
queries_month_2 = 1200  # Published paper cites this
queries_month_3 = 3500  # Goes viral in research community

# Earnings:
earnings_month_1 = 500 × 0.01 × 0.70 = 3.5 QFOT
earnings_month_2 = 1200 × 0.01 × 0.70 = 8.4 QFOT
earnings_month_3 = 3500 × 0.01 × 0.70 = 24.5 QFOT

# Total after 3 months: 36.4 QFOT
# ROI: (36.4 - 10) / 10 = 264% ✅

# Over 2 years of continued use:
# If maintains 3000 queries/month average:
# 3000 × 0.01 × 0.70 × 24 months = 504 QFOT
# ROI: 4,940% 🚀
```

**Value to Experts:**
✅ Passive royalty income forever
✅ More useful facts = more earnings
✅ Incentive to contribute high-quality data
✅ Recognition in scientific community

### 2. Validation Rewards (Expert Validators)

**Example: University as Trust Organization**

```python
# Harvard receives 400M × (1/100) = 4M QFOT initially
initial_stake = 4_000_000

# Validates 100 protein facts per month
# Stakes 50 QFOT on each
monthly_stake = 100 × 50 = 5,000

# Each fact generates validator rewards
avg_queries_per_fact = 500/month
validator_share = 0.02

monthly_earnings_per_fact = 500 × 0.01 × 0.02 = 0.1 QFOT
monthly_earnings_total = 100 × 0.1 = 10 QFOT

# Plus block validation rewards
# Harvard runs 1 validator node
block_rewards = 48,000 QFOT/month

# TOTAL MONTHLY EARNINGS:
# Block rewards: 48,000 QFOT
# Validation stakes: 10 QFOT
# Total: 48,010 QFOT/month
# Annual: 576,120 QFOT/year

# If QFOT = $1:
# $576,120/year for running a validator + validating facts
```

**Value to Universities:**
✅ Infrastructure funding (pay for validator servers)
✅ Research funding (stake on own research)
✅ Reputation (validator for truth)
✅ Student training (blockchain + ethics)

---

### 3. Refutation Rewards (Bounty Hunting)

**Example: Dr. Jones Challenges Bad Fact**

```python
# Bad Fact #9876 claims:
# "Protein X binds to ALL receptors with 100% affinity"

# Dr. Jones spots this as false (violates Temperance)
# Submits challenge:

challenge = {
    "fact_id": "9876",
    "evidence": "Contradicts binding study DOI:10.1234/xyz",
    "stake": 25.0  # Stakes 25 QFOT on challenge
}

# Ethics Node re-evaluates:
# 1. Checks contradiction with existing literature
# 2. Socratic reasoning: "What about receptor Y?"
# 3. Virtue assessment: Fails Temperance (extreme claim)
# 4. Result: ORIGINAL FACT REJECTED

# Slashing occurs:
original_staker_penalty = -50  # Lost 50 QFOT
challenger_reward = 50 × 0.5 = 25  # Gets 50% of slashed stake

# Dr. Jones earns:
# Challenge reward: 25 QFOT
# Reputation bonus: +100 points
# Gets original stake back: 25 QFOT
# NET PROFIT: 25 QFOT + reputation

# Original submitter:
# Lost: 50 QFOT stake
# Fact marked as REJECTED
# Reputation penalty: -500 points
```

**Value of Refutation System:**
✅ Keeps knowledge graph clean
✅ Rewards experts who catch errors
✅ Economic penalty for false claims
✅ Self-correcting system

---

## 🏢 How Platform Earns Value

### 1. Platform Maintenance Fee (15% of Gas Fees)

```python
# Daily transaction volume
daily_transactions = 1_000_000
avg_gas_fee = 0.01

# Daily gas fees
daily_gas = 1_000_000 × 0.01 = 10,000 QFOT

# Platform share (15%)
platform_daily = 10,000 × 0.15 = 1,500 QFOT

# Monthly
platform_monthly = 1,500 × 30 = 45,000 QFOT

# Annual
platform_annual = 45,000 × 12 = 540,000 QFOT

# If QFOT = $1:
# $540,000/year for platform operations
```

**What Platform Spends This On:**
- Server costs: $600/year (Hetzner)
- Developer salaries: $300,000/year (2 devs)
- Security audits: $50,000/year
- Marketing: $100,000/year
- Legal: $50,000/year
- Remaining: $40,000/year (profit or reinvestment)

---

### 2. Treasury Allocation (10% Initial Supply)

```python
treasury_tokens = 100_000_000  # 10% of 1B

# Used for:
# - Node operator grants (new countries)
# - Research grants (protein folding, FSI simulation)
# - Fact-checker partnerships
# - Academic collaborations
# - Bug bounties
```

**Governed by DAO:**
- Token holders vote on spending
- Requires 60% approval + 60% of country nodes
- Ethics Committee can veto unethical spending

## 🎯 Successful Refutation Economics

### Scenario 1: Catching a Bad Fact Early

```python
# Day 1: Bad fact submitted
bad_fact = {
    "claim": "Drug X cures all cancers",
    "stake": 50 QFOT,
    "ethical_confidence": 75  # Barely passed threshold
}

# Day 2: Expert challenges
challenger = {
    "evidence": "Contradicts FDA trial data",
    "stake": 25 QFOT
}

# Ethics Node re-evaluates:
# - Extreme claim (violates Temperance)
# - Contradicts existing medical facts
# - Socratic challenge: "What about Stage 4 patients?"
# Result: REJECTED

# Challenger earnings:
# 50% of original stake: 25 QFOT
# Reputation bonus: +100 points
# Return of challenge stake: 25 QFOT
# NET: +25 QFOT profit

# Platform value:
# Bad fact removed before widespread use
# Knowledge graph integrity maintained
# Prevents misinformation spread
```

### Scenario 2: Correcting a Popular but Wrong Fact

```python
# Year 1: Fact submitted and becomes popular
fact = {
    "claim": "Protein binding constant = 1.5 nM",
    "queries": 50,000/year,
    "creator_earnings": 50,000 × 0.01 × 0.70 = 350 QFOT/year
}

# Year 2: New research shows constant is actually 15 nM (10x off)
challenger = {
    "evidence": "DOI:10.1234/newpaper with updated measurement",
    "stake": 100 QFOT  # Higher stake for high-value fact
}

# Ethics Node + Human Expert Panel review:
# - Original measurement had equipment calibration error
# - New measurement is reproducible
# - Result: ORIGINAL FACT DEPRECATED, NEW FACT VALIDATED

# Challenger earnings:
# 50% of original stake: 50 QFOT (original staker had 100 staked)
# Reputation: +500 points (caught important error)
# NEW FACT CREATOR status
# Future queries now go to NEW FACT
# Future earnings: 50,000 × 0.01 × 0.70 = 350 QFOT/year

# Platform value:
# Knowledge graph self-corrected
# Science advances (accurate data)
# Users get correct information
```

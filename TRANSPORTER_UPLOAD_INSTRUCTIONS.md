# üì¶ Transporter Upload Instructions - Clinician v18

## üéØ What's Happening

**Problem**: Clinician v17 uploaded successfully but isn't showing in App Store Connect UI (even though Apple has it - hence the "v17 already exists" error).

**Solution**: Building v18 and you'll upload it manually via Transporter.

## 💰 Earnings Disclosure

### What You Can Earn

When you share knowledge, you earn SAFE tokens based on:
- **Base Reward:** 2.0 - 10.0 SAFE (depending on contribution type)
- **Confidence Multiplier:** Your AI confidence score
- **Usage Multiplier:** How many times others use your contribution
- **Creator Share:** 70% of total fees

**Example:**
- Medical diagnosis with 95% confidence
- Used by 50 other clinicians
- Earnings: 10.0 × 0.95 × 50 × 0.70 = **332.5 SAFE tokens**

### What That's Worth

**Current Value:** ❌ **$0.00 USD**

**Future Value:** ⚠️ **UNKNOWN and SPECULATIVE**

- May remain $0.00 forever
- May gain value if exchanges list SAFE
- May increase if adoption grows
- May decrease or become worthless
- **No guarantee of any future value**

## 📊 Value Scenarios

### Pessimistic Scenario (Most Likely)
- **Token Price:** $0.00
- **Your 332.5 SAFE:** Worth $0.00
- **Liquidity:** Cannot sell

### Neutral Scenario
- **Token Price:** $0.01 - $0.10
- **Your 332.5 SAFE:** Worth $3.33 - $33.25
- **Liquidity:** Limited trading on small exchanges

### Optimistic Scenario (Unlikely)
- **Token Price:** $0.50 - $1.00

## 🎯 Why Share If Tokens Have No Value?

### Non-Financial Reasons to Participate:

1. **Help Others** - Your knowledge benefits the community
2. **Build Reputation** - Become recognized as trusted contributor
3. **Advance Science** - Improve collective intelligence
4. **Professional Development** - Stay current with AI-assisted practice
5. **Altruism** - Pay it forward to help future users
6. **Governance** - Vote on platform decisions (1 token = 1 vote)

### Financial Considerations:

- **Potential Future Value** - IF token gains value later, early contributors benefit
- **Network Effects** - More users = more valuable network
- **First-Mover Advantage** - Early contributors get more tokens

**BUT:** ⚠️ **Assume financial value will be zero. Share for non-financial reasons.**

## ⚖️ Legal & Tax Implications

### Tax Treatment (U.S.)

**IRS Guidance:**
- Earned tokens = **ordinary income** at fair market value when received
- **Fair market value of SAFE = $0.00** (no established price)
- **Taxable income from SAFE = $0.00** (until tokens have value)

**If tokens gain value later:**
- Must report as income at receipt value ($0)
- Sale triggers capital gains/losses (cost basis = $0)

**Example:**
- Earn 332.5 SAFE when token value = $0
- Taxable income: $0
- Later, token price = $1.00
- Sell for $332.50
- Capital gain: $332.50 - $0 = $332.50 taxable

**Bottom Line:** No tax liability until tokens have value.

### Securities Law

**Status:** Utility token, not security

**Why not a security:**
- ✅ No investment contract
- ✅ Tokens earned, not sold
- ✅ No promise of profits
- ✅ Functional utility (knowledge access)

**Regulatory risk:** ⚠️ Crypto regulations evolving. Future laws may restrict token use.

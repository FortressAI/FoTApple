## üöÄ How to Deploy Watch Apps

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple
./scripts/deploy_watch_apps.sh
```

This will:
1. Build all 5 Watch app archives
2. Export IPAs for each Watch app
3. Upload to App Store Connect using the new API key
4. Provide detailed status for each app

### Option 2: Individual Watch App Deployment

If you need to deploy one Watch app at a time, edit the script to comment out apps you don't want to deploy.

## üìù Notes

### About SKUs
- SKUs are set when you first create an app in App Store Connect
- They cannot be changed after creation
- The exact SKUs for your apps can only be verified in App Store Connect:
  1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
  2. Select **My Apps**
  3. Click on each app
  4. Go to **App Information**
  5. Look for the **SKU** field

### API Key Security
- ‚úÖ API key is stored in `private_keys/` (excluded from git)
- ‚úÖ Configuration file is excluded from git
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.p8` files or `private_keys/` directory

### Watch App Requirements
- Watch apps must have the same Team ID as parent iOS apps
- Watch apps use separate bundle IDs (e.g., `com.akashic.PersonalHealth.watchkitapp`)
- The new API key should have "App Manager" role to create Watch app provisioning profiles

**New Key (`A746Z2JSK2`):**
- Role: App Manager (assumed)
- ‚úÖ Should be able to provision Watch apps via CLI

## ⚠️ What to Do if Deployment Fails

### If Individual App Fails:
1. Check app-specific logs in `build/logs/`
2. Look for error messages
3. Common issues:
   - Code signing problems → Check Team ID and certificates
   - Icon validation errors → Icons should be clean (already verified ✅)
   - Network issues → Retry upload
   - API key permissions → Should be fine with App Manager key ✅

### If All Apps Fail:
1. Verify API key is valid: `A746Z2JSK2`
2. Check API key permissions in App Store Connect
3. Verify Issuer ID: `d648c36b-f731-4c3e-bb88-32aad08f9f2d`
4. Check network connectivity

### Manual Recovery:
If automated deployment fails, you can:
1. Use existing archives in `build/archives/`
2. Open archives in Xcode Organizer
3. Upload manually via GUI

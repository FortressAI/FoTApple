# üöÄ TestFlight Deployment Guide

## Quick Start - Deploy All Apps

I've created a comprehensive deployment script that will build, archive, and upload all 5 apps to TestFlight automatically!

---

## ‚ö° One-Command Deployment

```bash
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple
chmod +x deploy_all_testflight.sh
./deploy_all_testflight.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Build all 5 apps
2. ‚úÖ Increment build numbers
3. ‚úÖ Create archives
4. ‚úÖ Export for App Store
5. ‚úÖ Validate each app
6. ‚úÖ Upload to TestFlight
7. ‚úÖ Show you a summary

**Time Required**: ~30-45 minutes for all 5 apps

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

### 1. **App Store Connect API Key** ‚úÖ
- Already found: `AuthKey_43BGN9JC5B.p8`
- Location: `/Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple/`

### 2. **Update API Issuer ID**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You need to update your API Issuer ID in the script!

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Click your name ‚Üí **Keys** (under Users and Access)
3. Copy your **Issuer ID**
4. Edit `deploy_all_testflight.sh` line 23:
   ```bash
   API_ISSUER_ID="YOUR-ISSUER-ID-HERE"  # Replace this!
   ```

### 3. **Code Signing**
- Team ID: `Y428L3AX98` (already configured)
- Using Automatic signing
- Ensure provisioning profiles are up to date

### 4. **Xcode**
- Version 15+ recommended
- Command line tools installed:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

## üéØ What The Script Does

### For Each App:

#### Step 1: Increment Build Number
- Automatically bumps CFBundleVersion
- Keeps track in Info.plist
- Ensures uniqueness for App Store

#### Step 2: Archive
- Cleans previous builds
- Creates Release configuration
- Generates .xcarchive file
- Saves to `build/archives/`

#### Step 3: Export
- Creates ExportOptions.plist
- Exports for App Store distribution
- Generates .ipa file
- Saves to `build/exports/`

#### Step 4: Validate
- Checks code signing
- Validates entitlements
- Verifies App Store requirements
- Logs any warnings

#### Step 5: Upload
- Uploads to App Store Connect
- Uses API authentication
- Shows upload progress
- Confirms success

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **"No such file or directory" Error**
```bash
# Verify you're in the right directory
cd /Users/richardgillespie/Documents/FoTApple
pwd  # Should show FoTApple directory
```

#### 2. **Code Signing Failed**
```bash
# Check your Apple Developer account
open "https://developer.apple.com/account/"

# Verify certificates and profiles
# Settings ‚Üí Your Name ‚Üí Developer ‚Üí Manage Certificates
```

#### 3. **Build Failed for Specific App**
```bash
# Build manually to see detailed errors
cd apps/PersonalHealthApp/iOS
xcodebuild -project PersonalHealthApp.xcodeproj \
  -scheme PersonalHealthApp \
  -configuration Release \
  clean build
```

#### 4. **Upload Timeout**
- Check internet connection
- Script will retry automatically
- Or upload manually via Xcode Organizer

#### 5. **API Authentication Failed**
- Verify API Key is in correct location
- Check API Issuer ID is correct
- Ensure API Key has "Admin" or "Developer" role

## üöÄ Advanced Options

### Deploy Single App

Edit `deploy_all_testflight.sh` to comment out apps you don't want:

```bash
declare -A APPS=(
    ["PersonalHealth"]="apps/PersonalHealthApp/iOS/PersonalHealthApp.xcodeproj:PersonalHealthApp"
    # ["Clinician"]="apps/ClinicianApp/iOS/FoTClinicianApp.xcodeproj:FoTClinicianApp"  # Skip
    # ["Legal"]="apps/LegalApp/iOS/FoTLegalApp.xcodeproj:FoTLegalApp"  # Skip
    # ["Education"]="apps/EducationApp/iOS/FoTEducationApp.xcodeproj:FoTEducationApp"  # Skip
    # ["Parent"]="apps/ParentApp/iOS/FoTParentApp.xcodeproj:FoTParentApp"  # Skip
)
```

### Dry Run (Archive Only)

Comment out upload section to test archiving without uploading:

```bash
# Step 5: Upload
# if upload_to_testflight "$app_name"; then
#     successful_uploads+=("$app_name")
# else
#     failed_uploads+=("$app_name")
# fi
```

### Custom Build Configuration

Edit archive commands to use different configurations:

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Internal Testing First**
   - Test with internal testers before external review
   - Catch issues early
   - Faster iteration

2. **Staggered Rollout**
   - Deploy one app at a time to test the script
   - Once confident, deploy all 5

3. **Version Management**
   - Keep marketing version (1.0, 1.1, 2.0) in Xcode
   - Let script auto-increment build numbers (1, 2, 3...)

4. **Backup Archives**
   - Archives saved in `build/archives/`
   - Keep them for debugging
   - Can re-export without rebuilding

5. **Monitor Crashes**
   - Check TestFlight crash reports
   - Organizer shows symbolicated crashes
   - Fix before App Store release

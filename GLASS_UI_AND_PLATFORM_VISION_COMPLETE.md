## üéØ Vision Expanded: Unified Sensor Platform

### New Understanding: One Reality, Many Contexts

Field of Truth is **not three separate apps** - it's a **unified platform** that captures reality using all device sensors and generates cryptographically-attested receipts. The same infrastructure serves:

1. **Citizen Legal** - Document incidents for justice
2. **Student Education** - Learn with verified context
3. **Personal Health** - Track wellness with proof
4. **Professional Clinician** - Evidence-based care

### Key Insight

**The same sensor capture when someone falls:**
- **Legal:** Evidence for injury claim
- **Health:** Fall detection, alert caregiver  
- **Education:** Physics of motion, safety learning

**The same fact-checking engine:**
- **Legal:** Verify witness statements
- **Education:** Check sources in research
- **Health:** Validate medical information

## üéØ The Vision is Clear

Field of Truth Apple is **not just three apps** - it's a **fundamental platform** for:

1. **Capturing reality** with every available sensor
2. **Generating cryptographic proof** that truth is truth
3. **Interpreting context** based on life situation (legal, education, health)
4. **Empowering individuals** to document, learn, and monitor
5. **Building trust** through verifiable receipts

**The same moment, captured once, serves many purposes:**
- Evidence in court
- Learning opportunity
- Health correlation
- Historical record

**All with cryptographic proof that it's real.**

---

## ‚ú® What's Next?

1. **Capture more screenshots** of all tabs in Clinician app
2. **Record demo videos** showing glass UI in action
3. **Implement sensor capture module** (foundation for all apps)
4. **Build Education & Legal showcases** with their themes
5. **Start Safari extension** development
6. **Create macOS apps** for desktop workflows

---

## üìù Notes for Future Development

### Remember:
- **Glass UI is live** and working - build on this foundation
- **User archetypes drive features** - always ask "which user needs this?"
- **Sensor data is universal** - interpretation is domain-specific
- **Receipts are everything** - cryptographic proof builds trust
- **Privacy first** - users control all sharing
- **Build for Apple platforms** - iOS, macOS, watchOS, Safari, visionOS

### Don't Forget:
- **Safari extension** is critical for web evidence capture
- **Apple Watch** integration for emergency capture
- **macOS apps** needed for professional workflows
- **Widgets** for quick access
- **visionOS** for future spatial computing

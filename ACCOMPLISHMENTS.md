## 🎉 Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Created Personal Health App (iOS + macOS)

**Why:** The Clinician app is for doctors. Patients needed their own app for personal health tracking.

**What We Built:**
- **iOS Version:** Quick capture with camera, sensors, location
- **macOS Version:** Desktop app with detailed entry and analysis
- **Both platforms:** Full feature parity, beautiful Glass UI

**Features:**
- Today's summary view
- Vitals tracking (temp, heart rate, BP, weight)
- Symptom documentation with photos
- Complete health timeline
- Doctor sharing with temporary access
- **Cryptographic receipts** for every entry

---

### 2. 🧠 Added Mental Health & Wellness (CRITICAL)

**Following "Do No Harm" Principles**

**Mental Health Tab Includes:**
- **Daily check-in:** Mood (1-10), sleep hours, stress level
- **Gratitude practice:** Evidence-based wellbeing journaling
- **Daily journal:** Private, encrypted thoughts and feelings
- **Wellness reminders:** Actionable self-care tips
- **Crisis support:** 🚨 Prominent button with 988, crisis lines, resources

**Safety Features:**
- Non-judgmental language throughout
- Clear disclaimer: "For tracking, not diagnosis"
- Professional help encouraged
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline prominently displayed
- Multiple crisis resources (Veterans, LGBTQ+, Trans, NAMI, SAMHSA)
- Privacy and encryption emphasized

**Why This Matters:**
- Mental health = physical health (full mind-body tracking)
- Cryptographic proof helps with disability claims, therapy notes
- Private journaling with mathematical certainty it's authentic
- Legal protection against gaslighting or denial of symptoms

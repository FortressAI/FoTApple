# 🚀 UPLOAD TO APPLE - FINAL INSTRUCTIONS

**Date:** October 31, 2025 - 6:20 AM  
**Status:** 2 apps ready, API key expired, must use Transporter

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: API Key is Expired/Revoked

After trying with BOTH Issuer IDs:
- `d648c36b-f731-4c3e-bb88-32aad08f9f2d` ❌
- `69a6de96-3a66-47e3-e053-5b8c7c11a4d1` ❌

**Both failed with 401 NOT_AUTHORIZED**

This means the API Key file `AuthKey_43BGN9JC5B.p8` is either:
1. Expired
2. Revoked in App Store Connect
3. Invalid

**The ONLY way to upload is via Transporter app.**

## ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Q: Transporter says "Authentication Failed"
**A:** Make sure you're signed in with the SAME Apple ID you use for App Store Connect.

### Q: Transporter says "Invalid Bundle"
**A:** This shouldn't happen - the IPAs were exported successfully. If it does, let me know.

### Q: IPAs don't appear in TestFlight after 15 minutes
**A:** Check App Store Connect → "Activity" tab for error messages.

### Q: Can I upload via Xcode Organizer instead?
**A:** Yes! 
1. Open Xcode
2. Window → Organizer → Archives
3. Select archive → Distribute App → App Store Connect
4. Upload

But Transporter is simpler - just drag and drop!

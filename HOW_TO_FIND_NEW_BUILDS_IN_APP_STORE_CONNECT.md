## ⚠️ If You DON'T See the Builds

### Possible Reasons:

#### 1. Still Processing (Most Likely)
**Solution**: Wait 5-10 more minutes, then refresh the page

**How to check:**
- Builds appear in Activity tab FIRST (even while processing)
- If you don't see them in Activity tab, they're still processing
- Check your email for "Processing Complete" notifications

#### 2. Looking in Wrong Place
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the **Activity tab**, not App Store tab

**Common mistake:**
- ❌ App Store tab → This shows submitted versions
- ✅ Activity tab → This shows ALL builds

#### 3. Wrong Account
**Solution**: Verify you're logged into the correct Apple Developer account

**Check:**
- Top right corner should show your account name
- Should be the account associated with Team ID: `WWQQB728U5`

#### 4. Processing Failed (Unlikely)
**Solution**: Check your email for error notifications

**Signs of failure:**
- Email with subject "Processing Failed"
- Email with compliance issues
- No builds appear after 45+ minutes

   - Subject: "Build [version] is ready to test"
   - Sent when processing completes (~30 min after upload)

3. **"Export Compliance" emails** (if needed)
   - Subject: "Export Compliance Required"
   - Need to answer encryption questions

## 🔄 Refresh Instructions

If you're currently on App Store Connect:

1. **Hard Refresh** the page:
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - The page may be cached

2. **Navigate away and back:**
   - Click "Home"
   - Click "My Apps"
   - Select your app again

3. **Try a different browser:**
   - Sometimes Safari caches aggressively

### In App Store Connect:
1. Click on build number (e.g., "14" or "15")
2. Look for **App Icon** preview section
3. You should see your NEW domain-specific icon
4. Compare with old builds (lower numbers) to see the difference

### In TestFlight App (when ready):

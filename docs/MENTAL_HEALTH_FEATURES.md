## 🔐 How Cryptographic Receipts Work

Every mental health entry receives a **receipt**:

1. **Timestamp:** When you made the entry
2. **Hash:** Cryptographic fingerprint of the content
3. **Signature:** Proves it hasn't been altered
4. **Device ID:** Which device recorded it

**Why This Matters:**
- **Legal protection:** Proves you documented symptoms on specific dates
- **Medical record:** Verifiable timeline for clinicians
- **Disability claims:** Objective evidence of condition progression
- **Research:** Contribute anonymized data with proven authenticity

**Privacy Maintained:**
- Receipt proves **existence** and **time** of entry
- Receipt does **NOT** reveal content
- Only you can decrypt the actual journal text
